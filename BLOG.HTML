                <p>
                    University of Sharpendo Online works in a similar way to a standard school or college â€“ only the classroom is online rather than in a physical building. With nearly 30 years of experience delivering learning in the classroom, University of Sharpendo used our extensive experience to build the best online learning environment for our lessons. Lessons are timetabled each week, and learners are expected to attend the lesson online and be prepared and ready to work! All our lessons involve interaction, our learners are involved in the lesson and there are plenty of opportunities to ask questions.

                    <br>
                    All lessons are recorded too, learners are able to review any lesson from their learning dashboard and can pause, rewind and replay as many times as needed.

                    <b>MOOCs</b> are free online courses that anybody can take to earn certificates upon completion. Top universities around the world increasingly offer MOOCs, and the total number of registered users of the Coursera and edX platforms has reached more than 20 million. Increasing numbers of students are also using MOOCs to improve their skills for employment or for changing careers by earning individually validated certificates of accomplishment which are issued for a fee.

                    In September 2013, USharpendo became the first Indian university to offer MOOCs, with two courses on the Coursera platform. USharpendo has offered six courses via Coursera and edX in the following two years.
                    <br>
                    USharpendo also offers Open Course Ware and has channel for USharpendo TV on YouTube.
